# Building AI-driven products that make money or save time


I care more about value over "best" practices and enjoy working on end-to-end systems—from backend to observability and tracing. Currently, I'm a **Senior Software Engineer at Emirates NBD**, building AI-powered solutions. I’m **certified in Azure AI-102 and Oracle Generative AI Professional**, but let's be real—certifications don't write code, experience does. I've been into software engineering for almost a decade now and been part of startups which had seen succesful exit and significant growth over time. Got laid off once and would join back in startups again due to the sheer joy of making something from nothing to something.

## 🛠️ What I Do

I like building things that actually work and don't just look good in a system design interview. My focus is on:

- **Making Full-Stack Work** – From backend APIs to front-end experiences, keeping things fast and scalable.
- **AI & LLMs** – Hands-on with **speech-to-text, call center analysis, RAG, and vector search**. If it involves embeddings, I’m in.
- **Cloud & DevOps** – Deploying apps with **Azure, Docker, Kubernetes**. Still learning the dark arts of DevOps, but I know enough to be dangerous.
- **System Design & Observability** – Logging, tracing, performance tuning—because flying blind is never fun.
- **Community Involvement** – Trying to stay active in **the AI ecosystem in UAE** and keeping up with the latest trends.

## Recent OSS Projects

### **AskData – Making Open Data Actually Usable**

It all started with a simple question: Can I save policymakers or researchers time when they need to analyze public data? (And we all know how painful that is.) So, at the Abu Dhabi Hackathon, I built **AskData**—an AI-powered search engine that makes querying open data as easy as chatting with a friend. The idea? You paste a link, and instead of endless spreadsheets, you get straight answers. It even made it to **Runners-up**! Not bad for a weekend project fueled by caffeine and questionable life choices.

### **SoccerBro – Because FIFA Trash Talk Needs Data**

Ever had that one friend who insists they’re the greatest FIFA player but conveniently forgets their losses? Enter **SoccerBro**—a tournament manager that not only tracks matches but also ensures no one gets away with fake bragging rights. Real-time match tracking, AI-driven insights, and enough stats to shut down any "but I totally won that game!" arguments. Built it for fun, but now? With friends spread across four different continents, I barely even have time to play!
